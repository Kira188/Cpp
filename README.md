Programs for Lab was created on notice that the code given by chat gpt and oline websites are highly inefficient and inconsistant which makes it harder for People to understand. 
Which is why I took it upon myself to code everything from scratch using minimal to no online help to produce only the most consistant and optimized code for people to easily 
understand the lab programs given to us during 3rd sem of CSBS 3rd Sem 2024 JSS-STU
